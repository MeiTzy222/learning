## Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning using BERT

This notebook is a modification of the training materials of Coursera Guided Project, _Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning using BERT_ (www.coursera.org/projects/sentiment-analysis-bert), with my personal learning notes.

When run on Google Colab using GPU, we could create a baseline BERT model, `bert-base-uncased`, that is capable of analysing Tweets' sentiment of 6 classes, i.e. `happy`, `not-relevant`, `angry`, `surprise`, `sad` and `disgust`. By following the codes shown in the course, with 10 epochs training, best F1 score recorded is 0.813.
